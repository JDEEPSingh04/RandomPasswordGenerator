# RandomPasswordGenerator
This is a short and easy project.

Creating a command-line tool that can generate random passwords based on user preferences can be accomplished using the Yargs JS package. Yargs is a Node.js package that allows you to easily create command-line tools and interfaces.

To begin, you can install Yargs using Node Package Manager (npm) by running the command: npm install yargs.

Once installed, you can create a new file and import Yargs with const yargs = require('yargs').

Next, you can define the command-line interface and options for your password generator using Yargs. For example, you can define options for the length of the password, the type of characters to include (e.g. letters, numbers, special characters), and whether or not to include uppercase letters.

With the Yargs options defined, you can then create a function that generates a random password based on the user's preferences. This function can use built-in JavaScript methods to generate random characters and combine them into a string.

Finally, you can use Yargs to parse the command-line arguments and call the password generation function with the user's preferences. The resulting password can be output to the console or saved to a file, depending on your needs.

Overall, creating a command-line tool for generating random passwords using Yargs can be a simple and effective way to provide a useful utility for users.
